            I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer. I work with startups and
            innovative companies to build great products that delight users.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an entrepreneur, I use Lean Startup techniques to quickly get to
            the root of the job to be done so that we can get value to customers
            as quickly as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            As an engineer, I specialize in full-stack web and mobile
            applications engineering using React & React Native, iOS/Swift,
            Elixir, and NodeJS. I also help teams build the best process for
            rapid innovation across the stack.
          </p>

          <p>My playbook is simple:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Start small and iterate</li>
            <li>Focus on people and their needs</li>
            <li>Help others become more excellent</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            I have worked directly with or contracted for tiny, early stage
            startups, fortune 100 companies, and global brands.
          </p>

          <p>
            By day I'm a full-stack native iOS engineer at{' '}
            <a href="https://yours.co">Yours.co</a>. By night, I'm a dad,
            husband, <a href="https://lds.org">Latter-day Saint</a>, and
            co-founder at <a href="https://coriaria.com">Coriaria</a> where we
