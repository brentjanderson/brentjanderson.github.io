ðŸ‘‹ I'm an entrepreneur and software engineer. I work with startups and innovative companies to build great products that delight users.

I specialize in full-stack web and mobile applications engineering using React & React Native, iOS/Swift, Elixir, and NodeJS.

My playbook is simple:

1. Start small and iterate
2. Focus on people and their needs
3. Help others become more excellent

I have worked directly with or contracted for tiny, early stage startups, fortune 100 companies, and global brands.

I blog weekly about topics in entreprenuership, business, and technology. You can check back here, or sign up for my newsletter below. No spam, unsubscribe at any time.
