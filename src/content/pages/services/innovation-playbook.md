Entrepreneurship is hard. By definition, it is full of uncertainty, risk, and challenges. For years, veteran entrepreneurs and academics have been developing and refining the science of entrepreneurship and innovation to improve startup outcomes. Brent has studied and applied this innovation science over his entire career so that he can help clients achieve the success they are looking for.

The "Innovation Playbook" consists of the following practices refined at startups and enterprises around the world.

## 1. Start with Vision

A vision is a picture, a view of the world. It is not a mission statement, and is poorly conveyed in merely words. A vision is a vivid, graphic image of what the future _could_ be like. It is a manifesto, a northern star, and will only last as long as its elements.

Having a clear view of what the future could be like is the starting point for any meaningful venture.

General Motors and Tesla offer a compelling contrast of visions. General Motors' vision is "to become the world’s most valued automotive company." The vision here is of a world where GM is valued. While compelling for GM, this vision is not particularly inspiring, and as a northern star is may actually guide GM on unsustainable paths (short-term value could rob long-term value). When a GM employee is working through a tough issue, this vision directs them to choose the outcome that encourages others to value GM.

Tesla's vision is "to create the most compelling car company of the 21st century by driving the world’s transition to electric vehicles." Tesla sees a future where the world is a better place because of electric vehicles. It is a global, forward-thinking, and ambitious mission. When a Tesla employee is working through a tough issue, they can ask themselves how this is going to help Tesla lead the adoption of electric vehicles.

## 2. Run a Design Sprint

Google's Design Sprint kit was developed through hundreds of experiements incorporating ideas from IDEO and Stanford d.school. It provides a clear framework to explore potential solutions to perceived problems, test them, and clarify them into clearly defined fgoals and deliverables. It is a tool to learn what you don't know.

## 3. Document and test your assumptions

## 5. Start small and grow
