Having heard a fair bit about Jekyll, and loving markdown, and having considered cfating my own blogging/journaling engine based on Git, and being potentially interested in using this combination to write books, I've decided to take the plunge and explore Jekyll as a blogging mechanism. So far it's been less straightforward than I would have expected, but now that I've got the domain and repo set up, I'm good to go. I'll be blogging a bit about my local windows setup, since I think I've come up with a slightly better way to run jekyll on windows than the recommended mechanism.
