_Here's the summary if you don't want all the detail:_

- Read and apply [The Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) by Eric Ries
- Get out and talk to customers
- Once you're ready to invest in an app, find someone who can build that team for you

# You have an idea

You have an idea that's going to change the world. You can feel it. You talk to your friends, and they say it's awesome.

> "All I need is to build it!"

You start asking your network, posting in user groups, and reaching out to old friends from school. "Could you build this?"

You talk to a design and development agency or consulting firm and you get back a quote bigger than the down payment on your house. 💸

Shell-shocked from the price, what do you do?

# Is there a better way?

What if I told you that you can build your idea faster and for less money? What if the finished product was actually _better_ than if you had gone all-in up front?

> There is a better way

This is a step-by-step guide for getting better results for your product. There are no shortcuts or "hacks". Instead, I summarize learnings from decades of research, practice, and experience from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs that I apply when working with clients. Although I encourage clients to understand the backstory (and provide links to books, articles, and blog posts to back up each piece), this guide is meant to condense the most important, practical pieces into an easy read.

If you would like help implementing this process for your product or startup, [contact me](/contact) and I will be happy to chat.

Here are the points of consideration I share with potential clients who bring up this topic. It applies to mobile apps, web applications, or any other type of software or product. We're going to roll with a few assumptions out of the gate:

- You want to make some money on this product (at least enough to break even)
- Your idea is non-trivial and will take real effort to build and get it right
- You want an app for iOS, Android, the desktop, or the web (or some mix of all four)
- You can't build it yourself

I'm going to write about software, but many of these points generalize for other products as well.

# It's not an app, it's a business

Step one is to realize that your product is not an app, **it's a business.**<a name="sup1" href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> An app is a product - an intended solution to a problem. A business is a vehicle to sustainably deliver that solution to customers. Unless you want an expensive hobby that you will maintain yourself for free, you must start with this mindset.

If it's a business and not a hobby, then you need to take a step back and ask some starting business questions:

- What problem are you trying to solve for your customers?
- Who are your customers in the first place? Are there multiple customer segments?
- How do you know they actually have the problems you think they have?
- How do your customers solve these problems today?
  - Who are your competitors (There are always competitors)?
  - Why is your solution at least 10x better?
- How will you get your product into your customers' hands?
- How will you create and maintain a great relationship with your customers?
- What does it cost to deliver your solution to each customer?
- How will you make enough money to maintain your solution?

These questions are not magic. They are also not exhaustive. As an entrepreneur, **your job is to eliminate risk**. Getting real answers to these and other questions is critical to doing your job.

# Your business model

I encourage anyone interested in entrepreneurship to study the [business model canvas](https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas). When you first get started, print out a blueprint-sized copy of the canvas, and fill it with sticky notes detailing what you believe about your potential business. Who are your customers? What do they care about? What is your value proposition? How will you reach customers? How will you deliver your value to customers? What will it take to support your business?

Filling in this canvas can be an eye-opening experience. With an eye of honesty towards your canvas, does it make sense? Can you explain it with clarity to potential advisors, or even customers? If you find it hard to believe your canvas up front, stop and reconsider your assumptions. What things need to hold true for it to fit? Examine your assumptions, and work on the canvas until you have clarity around your message, what you are offering to customers, and what you can do to refine that message and value proposition.

As a word of caution, **do not waste too much time with the canvas**. The above questions and canvas modelling exercise should take no more than a day or two. It serves to help clarify and structure your thinking, so that you can...

# Hit the pavement

The next step is to start talking to customers. If you don't know who your customers are, you need to rewind and start at the top of this process. Where do they meet? How can you connect with them? This stage of the process is not what many consider traditional business work. Its more like a combination of anthropology and therapy. As you sit down to meet with customers, clear your head of anything about how this conversation will benefit you. These conversations must be squarely set on discovering your customer's pain. Do not talk about your intended solution. Don't bring it up. You must be 100% committed to listening. Ask open-ended questions, and listen.

# Footnotes

<a name="footnote1" href="#sup1">1</a>: Most apps achieve failure because of business problems and not technical problems. In today's saturated world with millions of apps and billions of websites, the challenge is not building something. The challenge is making a difference in the lives of real people. The technology is an implementation detail to that end.
