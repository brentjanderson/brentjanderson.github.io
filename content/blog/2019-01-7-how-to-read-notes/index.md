description: Some notes from Farnam Street's course on "How to Read"
---

These are some unstructured notes from a [free video][video-course] published by
[Farnam Street][farnam-street] on how to read. These notes are just a loose
collection, so don't take them as definitive or even complete, but they seemed
useful.

1. Read from multiple perspectives
    * Read many perspectives from multiple authors
    * "Read syntopically"
2. Effort and concentration
    * Skim and superficial reading to filter and prepare for reading
    * Determine who is worth listening to, what their positions are
    * Cluster reading close to each other temporally

-- Five steps to read well --

1. Find relevant passages to read
    * Do an intelligent/thorough skim of the material
    * Create bibliography to figure out how to get the most out of the material
    * Read it all comparitively
2. Translate vocabulary
3. Clear questions on what you want answered
4. Define the issue
    * What are the different takes from things?
5. Analyze the discussions

"It's an illusion that we actually understand the past after learning about it."
