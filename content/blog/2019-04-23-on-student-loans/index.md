Recently, Elizabeth Warren announced [universal free public college and cancellation of student loan debt](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/im-calling-for-something-truly-transformational-universal-free-public-college-and-cancellation-of-a246cd0f910f). I've mulled over the announcement, which was posted to Medium yesterday but announced a few days ago.

First and foremost, we need to consider what it even means to get a degree from higher education anymore. We live in a society that considers a Bachelor's degree (and sometimes even a Master's degree) as an entry-level requirement for positions and work that may not generate more economic output than positions that do not require such education. I'm not talking about the importance of getting an education for its own value. As a colleague mentioned recently, many people need to meet their basic needs before they can worry about shakespeare.

I believe in the importance of education for its own sake, but insist that education must also make an improvement in the life of the individual. It is a service, and a service without an aim beyond cultural imporvement is of limited benefit to the individual receiving the service. It must be both for education's sake as well as for enabling future potential. Not all educations are created equal - education is not a commodity that is easily interchangable. The value of an education from a community college is very different from a major public or private university.

## The system is broken

There are roughly three participants in the financial aspects of higher education, from the perspective of the student: the student themselves as the recipient of the educational service, the university as the provider of the service, and a payer footing the bill. The "payer" could be any combination of the student, family and friends, scholarships, grants, or student loan providers. In our system, universities are guaranteed payment. They refuse services to those who cannot provide cash. This is fair, since the university would eventually become insolvent without revenues.

The student is under tremendous pressures to obtain an education. The promise of a better life, of better employment, of greater economic potential are generally the reasons we go to school. Unfortunately, the student deals with information asymmetry. Without a crystal ball, they have no idea how to compare one university's product to another university. Most of the benefit of a university, in my opinion, is the network of individuals you are exposed to and connect with while at the university. The friendships we forge in a university can last a lifetime, and can be the best source of future employment and opportunities, enrichment, connection, love, and growth out of everything a university has to offer. The education, in some respects, is a secondary benefit to the student. Imagine a university without the social connection and compare it to one with the benefits of a strong network of alumni and peers. The difference is stark.

Those funding the education are not necessarily the recipients of the education itself. Instead, they are driven by a handful of motives:

* Love and care for the student (friends, family, or the student themselves)
* Love and care for society (e.g. those who fund scholarships)
* Profit motive (e.g. financing like student loans)

The first two motives do not generally replenish themselves, and are thus non-perpetuating.
