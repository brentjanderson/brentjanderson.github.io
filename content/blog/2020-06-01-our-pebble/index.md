Lost for words  
Our voice feels small  
What pebble can we toss in  
That will matter at all?

But if we don’t toss it in,  
Will anyone know  
We stand on the banks  
And not just for show?

It’s not really standing  
we came here to do  
We came here to kneel,  
And maybe plead too.

Really, how can we expect  
To kneel before our Maker  
if we procrastinate solidarity  
with our human family until later?

We came here to kneel -  
Not on the backs of the “others”  
Rather, to kneel hand in hand  
With our parents, sisters & brothers

When we look our Maker in the eyes  
Will we mask our face in shame?  
Or will He look in our eyes because  
we’re masked for someone unnamed?

While we sit in our home  
A bubble away from chaos  
We’re privileged to breathe  
With a mask without loss

So as we stand on the banks  
With pebble in hand  
We may not know how to jump in  
But we seek to understand

We don’t care to go back to “normal”  
When all this is through  
We want to get right back up  
And start things anew

A new strength in families  
unity and equality for each  
Actual respect and sincere care  
A consistent habit of outreach

Wet from the baptism of a virus,  
the ashes and flame  
We know in the end  
Things can’t stay the same

We know we will stumble  
As we try with our might  
But better to try  
Than to hide from the light.

People need love and  
Families need a stand,  
But that ripple won’t happen  
If it stays in our hand.
