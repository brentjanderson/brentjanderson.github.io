I started at Lambda School this year, writing software to help students and
staff be more productive. As with any modern software job, I had to set up a new
laptop with all of the tools I rely on each day to get the job done.

After setting up the laptop and tightening up a few pieces, here is my
definitive guide to what I install, and why.

## The Hardware

15" Macbook Pro (Space Gray) - Intel core i7, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB SSD

I've debated whether or not I want to dive into a Thinkpad with Ubuntu, but my
inertia with Mac is pretty strong. No reason to try something new just for fun.

Also, I don't particularly care about Space Gray vs. Silver, but my home laptop
is silver so space gray helps me keep track of which one I'm using.

## Mac Apps

* Spark for eMail
* Firefox
* Spotify
* Slack
* Monday.com
* Notion
* Zoom Conference
* 1Password
* Amethyst for window management
* Dropbox
* Keybase
* F.lux
* Fohkuhs Pomodoro Timer
* Visual Studio Code
* iTerm 2
* Docker for Mac

## Command Line Work
