Brent was one of the first to use and evangelize Docker Containers in 2013. Docker enables development teams to move faster and with greater confidence. By wrapping an application and its dependencies into a single unit of work, teams can develop, test, and deploy sophisticated applications with consistency across environments.

Brent has worked with teams from startups to large enterprises developing and deploying Docker containers using orchestration platforms such as Rancher and Kubernetes, and can help teams make the jump to cloud-native tools and architectures quickly.
