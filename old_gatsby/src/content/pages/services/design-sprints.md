Brent uses design sprints to kick of new projects with clients. Each design sprint clarifies business requirements and sets the stage for the
next step of the [innovation playbook](./innovation-playbook): Using Lean Startup principles to setup experiments with customers.

## What is a design sprint?

> "A Design Sprint is a five-day process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers."

Design sprints were developed at Google Ventures to solve complex product problems quickly and efficiently. Using a combination of creative thinking strategies, emergent and divergent thinking, quick decision making, and customer feedback, teams can jump from ideas to customer validated learning without building the full product. Design sprints set teams on the right track for future lean/agile development.

## How does it work?

A design sprint compresses several weeks of building and learning into a single, highly focused week. Starting from what a team knows about customers and their intended product, a design sprint week walks teams through a set of activities that culminates in user prototype testing. User testing generates new insights that the team can use as a foundation for the next version of a product, or for another design sprint. Starting on Monday, teams set the sprint's goal and begin to systematically explore the problem and solution using rapid prototyping and supported decision making. Each day builds up to a prototype and customer interviews. As customers experience your prototype solution, your team gains valuable insight into the next version of the product and what to accomplish next.
