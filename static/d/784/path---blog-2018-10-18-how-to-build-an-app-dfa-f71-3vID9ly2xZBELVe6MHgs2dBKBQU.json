You can feel it. You talk to your friends, and they say it's awesome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All I need is to build it!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You start asking your network, posting in user groups, and reaching out to old friends from school. \"Could you build this?\"</p>\n<p>Here are the points of consideration I share with potential clients who bring up this topic. It applies to mobile apps, web applications, or any other type of software or product. I'm going to write about software, but many of these points generalize for other products as well. We're going to roll with a few assumptions out of the gate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to make some money on this product (at least enough to break even)</li>\n<li>Your idea is non-trivial and will take real effort to build and get it right</li>\n<li>You want an app for iOS, Android, the desktop, or the web (or some mix of all four)</li>\n<li>You</li>\n<li>You can't build it yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Building a product is a significant investment</h1>\n<h1>It's not an app, it's a startup</h1>\n<p>Step one is to realize that your product is not an app, it's a business. An app is a product - an intended solution to a problem. <a href=\"https://steveblank.com/2010/01/25/whats-a-startup-first-principles/\">A startup is an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.</a> A business is a vehicle to sustainably deliver that solution to customers.</p>\n<p>This does not apply if you are starting a hobby that you will maintain yourself for free. If you are truly interested in the long-term life of your product, you must start with the long-term in mind. Hobbies won't last. Businesses are meant to be long-term.</p>\n<p>If it's a business, then you need to take a step back and ask the business questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What problem are you trying to solve for your customers?</li>\n<li>Who are your customers in the first place? Are there multiple customer segments?</li>\n<li>How do you know they actually have the problems you think they have?</li>\n<li>How will you get your product into your customers' hands?</li>\n<li>How will you create and maintain a great relationship with your customers?</li>\n<li>What does it cost to deliver your solution to each customer?</li>\n<li>How will you make enough money to maintain your solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although it is more affordable than ever to start a business, if it costs $1.00 to support each customer, but each customer pays you $0.99 or less, someone will need to make up that penny. That someone will be you. Avoid this viscious cycle. Be intentional in how you design your business. Engineer it for success.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Step 1: Customer Development</h1>\n<h1>Step 2: Start small and learn fast</h1>\n<h1>Step 3: Keep at it</h1>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 18, 2018","title":"How to build an app"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-10-18-how-to-build-an-app/"}}},"pageContext":{}}
