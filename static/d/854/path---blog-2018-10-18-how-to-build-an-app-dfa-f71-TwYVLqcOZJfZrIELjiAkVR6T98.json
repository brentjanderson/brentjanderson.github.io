You can feel it. You talk to your friends, and they say it's awesome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All I need is to build it!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You start asking your network, posting in user groups, and reaching out to old friends from school. \"Could you build this?\"</p>\n<p>Here are the points of consideration I share with potential clients who bring up this topic. It applies to mobile apps, web applications, or any other type of software or product. We're going to roll with a few assumptions out of the gate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to make some money on this product (at least enough to break even)</li>\n<li>Your idea is non-trivial and will take real effort to build and get it right</li>\n<li>You want an app for iOS, Android, the desktop, or the web (or some mix of all four)</li>\n<li>You can't build it yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm going to write about software, but many of these points generalize for other products as well.</p>\n<h1>It's not an app, it's a business</h1>\n<p>Step one is to realize that your product is not an app, it's a business. An app is a product - an intended solution to a problem. A business is a vehicle to sustainably deliver that solution to customers.</p>\n<p>This does not apply if you are starting a hobby that you will maintain yourself for free. If you are truly interested in the long-term life of your product, you must start with the long-term in mind. Hobbies won't last. Businesses are meant to be long-term.</p>\n<p>If it's a business and not a hobby, then you need to take a step back and ask the business questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What problem are you trying to solve for your customers?</li>\n<li>Who are your customers in the first place? Are there multiple customer segments?</li>\n<li>How do you know they actually have the problems you think they have?</li>\n<li>\n<p>How do your customers solve these problems today?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are your competitors (There are always competitors)?</li>\n<li>Why is your solution at least 10x better?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How will you get your product into your customers' hands?</li>\n<li>How will you create and maintain a great relationship with your customers?</li>\n<li>What does it cost to deliver your solution to each customer?</li>\n<li>How will you make enough money to maintain your solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although it is more affordable than ever to start a business, if it costs $1.00 to support each customer, but each customer pays you $0.99 or less, someone will need to make up that penny. That someone will be you. Avoid this viscious cycle. Be intentional in how you design your business. Engineer it for success.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h1>Step 1: Customer Development</h1>\n<h1>Step 2: Start small and learn fast</h1>\n<h1>Step 3: Keep at it</h1>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 18, 2018","title":"How to build an app"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-10-18-how-to-build-an-app/"}}},"pageContext":{}}
