You can feel it. You talk to your friends, and they say it's awesome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"All I need is to build it!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You start asking your network, posting in user groups, and reaching out to old friends from school. \"Could you build this?\"</p>\n<p>Here are the points of consideration I share with potential clients who bring up this topic. It applies to mobile apps, web applications, or any other type of software or product. We're going to roll with a few assumptions out of the gate:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You want to make some money on this product (at least enough to break even)</li>\n<li>Your idea is non-trivial and will take real effort to build and get it right</li>\n<li>You want an app for iOS, Android, the desktop, or the web (or some mix of all four)</li>\n<li>You can't build it yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm going to write about software, but many of these points generalize for other products as well.</p>\n<h1>It's not an app, it's a business</h1>\n<p>Step one is to realize that your product is not an app, <strong>it's a business.</strong> An app is a product - an intended solution to a problem. A business is a vehicle to sustainably deliver that solution to customers. Unless you want an expensive hobby that you will maintain yourself for free, you must start with this mindset.</p>\n<p>If it's a business and not a hobby, then you need to take a step back and ask some starting business questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What problem are you trying to solve for your customers?</li>\n<li>Who are your customers in the first place? Are there multiple customer segments?</li>\n<li>How do you know they actually have the problems you think they have?</li>\n<li>\n<p>How do your customers solve these problems today?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who are your competitors (There are always competitors)?</li>\n<li>Why is your solution at least 10x better?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>How will you get your product into your customers' hands?</li>\n<li>How will you create and maintain a great relationship with your customers?</li>\n<li>What does it cost to deliver your solution to each customer?</li>\n<li>How will you make enough money to maintain your solution?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting with the above questions will help you explore the problem and solution that you are working on in detail.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 18, 2018","title":"How to build an app"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2018-10-18-how-to-build-an-app/"}}},"pageContext":{}}
