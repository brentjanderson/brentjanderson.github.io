The truths he writes about apply broadly.</p>\n<p>Reading this reminds me of the best literature in engineering reliable software systems. The pattern that seems to be most powerful is to declare how things ought to be, and to have a machine that is responsible for herding what it observes in your system towards what you said it's supposed to be. Kubernetes manifests come to mind in particular.</p>\n<p>Having strong precision is important because it can help clean up a lot of the messes before you get it out into the real world. Type systems, static analysis, test coverage, and other pre-flight checks help rule out classes of problems that you would otherwise have to build resilience for.</p>\n<p>From there, we can focus on resilience.
