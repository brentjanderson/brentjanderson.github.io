{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I started at Lambda School this year, writing software to help students and\nstaff be more productive. As with any modern software job, I had to set up a new\nlaptop with all of the tools I rely on each day to get the job done.</p>\n<p>After setting up the laptop and tightening up a few pieces, here is my\ndefinitive guide to what I install, and why.</p>\n<h2>The Hardware</h2>\n<p>15\" Macbook Pro (Space Gray) - Intel core i7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD</p>\n<p>I've debated whether or not I want to dive into a Thinkpad with Ubuntu, but my\ninertia with Mac is pretty strong. No reason to try something new just for fun\nat this juncture. Same thing applies to Vim, although I may take some time to\nget into it at some point.</p>\n<p>Also, I don't particularly care about Space Gray vs. Silver, but my home laptop\nis silver so space gray helps me keep track of which one I'm using.</p>\n<h2>Mac Apps</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Spark for eMail</li>\n<li>Firefox</li>\n<li>Spotify</li>\n<li>Slack</li>\n<li>Monday.com</li>\n<li>Notion</li>\n<li>Zoom Conference</li>\n<li>1Password</li>\n<li>Amethyst for window management</li>\n<li>Dropbox</li>\n<li>Keybase</li>\n<li>F.lux</li>\n<li>Fohkuhs Pomodoro Timer</li>\n<li>Visual Studio Code</li>\n<li>iTerm 2</li>\n<li>Docker for Mac</li>\n<li>Postgres.app for local <code>psql</code> command support</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Command Line Work</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You can tell a lot about an engineer by the contents of his shell profile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>iTerm 2 is my preferred terminal since it's easy to configure and the profiles\nare transferrable between machines.</p>\n<h3>ZSH &#x26; Oh-my-zsh</h3>\n<p>I like the plugins <a href=\"https://ohmyz.sh/\">Oh-my-zsh</a> comes packed with: <code>git</code>, <code>docker</code>, <code>node</code>, <code>yarn</code>.</p>\n<p>I use the <code>agnoster</code> theme with <a href=\"https://github.com/powerline/fonts\">powerline-fonts</a> installed.</p>\n<h3>nvm &#x26; node</h3>\n<p>Although I prefer <a href=\"https://asdf-vm.com/\">asdf</a> for versioning dependencies, however to be consistent with our team standards I installed <a href=\"https://github.com/creationix/nvm\">nvm</a> for handling our node versions.</p>\n<p>I set up an <code>~/.nvmrc</code> file as well for some global defaults as needed, including version pinning for dependencies.</p>\n<h3>psql</h3>\n<p>I install <a href=\"https://postgresapp.com/\">Postgres.app</a> so it's easy to get <code>psql</code> on my command line.</p>\n<p>I have a <code>.psqlrc</code> file to set up table formatting and other features of <code>psql</code> so it becomes my go-to tool for interacting with postgres (typically over GUI clients).</p>\n<h3>Homebrew</h3>\n<p>I install <a href=\"https://brew.sh\">Homebrew</a> so that it's easy to get components I need installed. I typically install <code>fx</code> for reading JSON files and <code>wget</code> out of the gate.</p>\n<h2>Visual Studio Code</h2>\n<p>VS Code is a fantastic code editor that can be extended to essentially be a full IDE. Although someday I might jump into tmux and vim, VS Code is fast, easy to use and set up, and it works very well.</p>\n<p>My preferred base extensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>DotENV</li>\n<li>ESLint</li>\n<li>Docker</li>\n<li>markdownlint</li>\n<li>GitLens</li>\n<li>npm</li>\n<li>vscode-icons</li>\n<li>VS Live Share</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I add in additional extensions for other language supports.</p>\n<h2>Ad, Tracking, and other blocking with DNSMasq</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html\">DNSMasq</a> is a bundle of network infrastructure services, including a DNS resolver. I use DNSMasq to block trackers, ad networks, and time wasting websites cold. Here's how setup works:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>brew install dnsmasq</code></li>\n<li>Edit <code>/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf</code> so it includes the following line: <code>conf-dir=/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/,*.conf</code></li>\n<li>Add a directory <code>/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d</code></li>\n<li>Configure basic dnsmasq settings by adding a file to <code>/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.d/resolvers.conf</code> with the following contents:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-conf\"># Tell dnsmasq to get its DNS servers from this config file only\nno-resolv\n# Add alternate DNS servers\nserver=208.67.222.222\nserver=208.67.220.220\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure another dnsmasq.conf file <code>time-wasters.conf</code> with the following format:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"language-conf\">address=/.facebook.com/facebook.com/ # This stops any domain under facebook.com\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>sudo brew services start dnsmasq</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Firefox</h2>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://duck.com\">Duck.com</a> for search</p>\n<p>Extensions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1Password extension</li>\n<li>HTTPS Everywhere</li>\n<li>Privacy Badger</li>\n<li>Terms of Service; Didn't Read</li>\n<li>uBlock Origin</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other details</h2>\n<p>I will update this with further details, but for now this is the base setup I prefer to use on my system.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 07, 2019","title":"How I set up my machine"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/2019-01-07-how-i-set-up-my-machine/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
